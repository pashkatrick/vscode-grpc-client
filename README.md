## About
I hope, that should make it easier and more flexibility to work with [gprc_cli](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/command_line_tool.md) or [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl)'s like gRPC queries providers.  
And also you can a storage collections of queries inside vscode now :)  

## Get Started ðŸš€
`brew install grpc` or/and `brew install grpcurl` if you haven't.  

Install [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pashkatrick.grpc-client) in VS Code.    
Set your gRPC requests like this:
